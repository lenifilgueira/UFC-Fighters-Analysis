# UFC Fighters Statistics Analysis

This project involves analyzing the statistics of UFC fighters using Python and various data analysis libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Jupyter Notebook.

Dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/ufc-fighters-statistics)

## Overview

The Python script reads a CSV file containing UFC fighter statistics and performs various analyses, visualizations, and explorations on the data.

## Analysis Sections

1. **Win-Loss Distribution Analysis:**
   - Calculate win percentages for each fighter and analyze the spread.
   - Visualize the distribution of wins and losses among fighters using histograms.
   - Identify fighters with the most wins, losses, and draws.

2. **Biographical Characteristics Analysis:**
   - Explore the distribution of fighters' heights, weights, and reaches.
   - Investigate correlations between biographical factors and performance.

3. **Temporal Analysis:**
   - Examine the distribution of fighters' dates of birth.
   - Group fighters by different time periods or age ranges for analysis.

4. **Fighting Stance Comparison:**
   - Compare win percentages among different fighting stances (Orthodox, Southpaw, Switch).

5. **Top Performers Identification:**
   - Identify fighters with the most wins or highest win percentages.
   - Find fighters with the most draws or losses.

6. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - Explore correlations between different attributes (e.g., height and reach, wins and losses).

7. **Experience and Age Analysis:**
   - Investigate the relationship between the number of fights and age.
   - Analyze whether experience (number of fights) impacts win rates.

8. **Visualization and Storytelling:**
   - Use various visualizations to convey insights and trends within the data.
   - Create comparative visualizations to highlight differences among fighters.

9. **Outlier Detection:**
   - Identify outliers in different statistics (e.g., extremely tall or short fighters, unusual win-loss ratios).

10. **Fighter Performance Over Time:**
    - Analyze changes in performance over time for individual fighters.
    - Investigate trends in win rates or other statistics across different years or periods.

11. **Regional Analysis:**
    - Analyze statistics based on fighters' regions or countries.
    - Investigate whether certain regions produce more successful fighters.

12. **Fight Outcome Analysis:**
    - Analyze how certain attributes (height, weight, reach, stance) might influence fight outcomes.

## Usage

To run the analysis, follow these steps:
1. Make sure you have Python and the required libraries installed.
2. Download the 'ufc-fighters-statistics.csv' file containing the UFC fighters' data.
3. Open the Python script provided and update the file path to your downloaded CSV file.
4. Run the script to perform the analysis and explore the results.

Feel free to explore and modify the script for your analysis. Please reach and share any feedback :smiley:
